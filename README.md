# robot_learning
Interface for robot learning experiments in ROS. Based on gym environments


This package (along with https://github.com/juancamilog/kusanagi)  was used to generate the results of our IROS 2018 submission " [Synthesizing Neural Network Controllers with Probabilistic Model based Reinforcement Learning](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~gamboa/publications/iros_2018_model_based_rl.pdf)"

A video demonstration of some of the results in the paper is available here
